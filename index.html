            <h1>Computer Engineering</h1>
            <p>Computer engineering (CoE or CpE) is a branch of electrical engineering and computer science that
                integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer
                hardware and software.[1] Computer engineers not only require training in electronic engineering,
                software design, and hardware-software integration, but also in software engineering.

                <h1>Mechanical Engineering</h1>
                <p1>Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is
                    an
                    engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials
                    science,
                    to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.[1] It is one of the oldest and
                    broadest of the engineering branches.

                    Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction,
                    and
                    maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads,
                    bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and
                    railways.
